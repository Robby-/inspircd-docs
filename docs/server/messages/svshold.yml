    duration: The duration of the services hold.

  If `<duration>` and `<reason>` are specified then place a services hold on the specified nickname. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero then the services hold will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<nick>` is specified, removes a services hold on a nickname.

  This is similar to a Q-line only it is more suitable for nickname enforcement as:

  - It can only be applied by a services server.
  - It does not notify server operators.
  - It can be bypassed the user of a registered account.
