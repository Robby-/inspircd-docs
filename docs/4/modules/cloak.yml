description: |-
  This module adds user mode `x` (cloak) which allows user hostnames to be hidden.

configuration:
- name: cloak

    The `<cloak>` tag defines a cloaking profile. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

    The method field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value            | Module                                  | Description
    ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | -----------
    account          | [cloak_user](/4/modules/cloak_user)     | Cloak the user with their account name. Requires [the account module](/4/configuration/account).
    account-id       | [cloak_user](/4/modules/cloak_user)     | Cloak the user with their account id. Requires [the account module](/4/configuration/account).
    fingerprint      | [cloak_user](/4/modules/cloak_user)     | Cloak the user with their TLS fingerprint. Requires [the sslinfo module](/4/configuration/sslinfo).
    full             | [cloak_md5](/4/modules/cloak_md5)       | *Deprecated!* Cloak with three salted MD5 hashes of significant ranges of a user's IP address (IPv4: /16 /24 /32, IPv6: /32 /48 /64). Does not cloak UNIX socket users. Requires [the md5 module](/4/configuration/md5).
    half             | [cloak_md5](/4/modules/cloak_md5)       | *Deprecated!* If the user has a DNS hostname then cloak all but the last few labels with a salted MD5 hash. Otherwise, cloak with a salted MD5 hash of the most unique /16 subnet of a IPv4 address or /48 subnet of a IPv6 address. Does not cloak UNIX socket users. Requires [the md5 module](/4/configuration/md5).
    hmac-sha256      | [cloak_sha256](/4/modules/cloak_sha256) | If the user has a DNS hostname or is connecting via a UNIX socket then cloak with an HMAC-SHA256 hash of their hostname and socket path suffixed with the public part of that value. Otherwise, cloak with three HMAC-SHA256 hashes of significant ranges of their IP address (IPv4: /16 /24 /32, IPv6: /32 /48 /64). Requires [the sha2 module](/4/configuration/sha2).
    hmac-sha256-addr | [cloak_sha256](/4/modules/cloak_sha256) | If the user is connecting via a UNIX socket then cloak with an HMAC-SHA256 hash of their socket path suffixed with the public part of the path. Otherwise, cloak with three HMAC-SHA256 hashes of significant ranges of their IP address (IPv4: /16 /24 /32, IPv6: /32 /48 /64). Requires [the sha2 module](/4/configuration/sha2).
    nickname         | [cloak_user](/4/modules/cloak_user)     | Cloak the user with their nickname.
    username         | [cloak_user](/4/modules/cloak_user)     | Cloak the user with their real username.

    required: false
    default: 'Yes'

  example: |-
    Disables cloaking for users in the "Example" connect class:

    ```xml

             ...

special_notes: |-
  The first `<cloak>` tag will be used for the cloak set when a user enables user mode `x` (cloak). The rest will be generated and used to check bans. This allows you to migrate cloaking mode or to change your cloaking key without breaking your bans.
