description: |-
  This module adds user facing TLS information, various TLS configuration options, and the `/SSLINFO` command to look up TLS certificate information for other users.

configuration:
- name: connect
  description: |-
    This module extends [the core `<connect>` tags](/4/configuration#connect) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name: requiressl
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: 'no'
    description: |-
      Whether users must be using TLS to use this class.
  details: |-
    The requiressl field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value   | Description
    ------- | -----------
    no      | TLS is not required to use this class.
    trusted | TLS is required and and a CA-verified client certificate must be provided to use this class.
    yes     | TLS is required to use this class.

  example: |-
    Requires users to be using TLS to be assigned to the Secure class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="Secure"
             ...
             requiressl="yes">
    ```
- name: [oper, type]
  description: |-
    This module extends the core [`<oper>`](/4/configuration#oper) and [`<type>`](/4/configuration#type) tags with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name: fingerprint
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: null
    description: |-
      If defined then a space-delimited list of TLS client certificate fingerprints to check against this server operator's TLS client certificate.
  - name: sslonly
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'No'
    description: |-
      Whether this server operator must be connected using TLS to log into their account.
  example: |-
    Requires Sadie to connect with TLS with the TLS client certificate fingerprint `5d7499e1a3537687a2e875fed60b171508a4d1384351e276c4f961ab80729249` in order to log in to their server operator account:

    ```xml

          fingerprint="5d7499e1a3537687a2e875fed60b171508a4d1384351e276c4f961ab80729249"
          sslonly="yes">
    ```

    Requires server operators of type NetAdmin to connect with TLS with the TLS client certificate fingerprint `5d7499e1a3537687a2e875fed60b171508a4d1384351e276c4f961ab80729249` in order to log in to their server operator account:

    type: Text
    required: false
    default: null
    description: |-
      The IANA Hash Function Textual Name of the hash algorithm used when getting client fingerprints sent by a WebIRC gateway. Prefix with `spki-` to use a Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) fingerprint for WebIRC gateway clients instead of a certificate fingerprint.
  - name: localsecure
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
