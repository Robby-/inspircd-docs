name: md5

introduction: |-
  !!! warning ""
      This module is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of InspIRCd.

description: |-
  This module allows other modules to generate [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hashes.

special_notes: |-
  MD5 is widely considered insecure and should not be used for hashing passwords. You should use hmac-sha256 for this purpose instead (requires [the password_hash module](/4/modules/password_hash) and [the sha2 module](/4/modules/sha2)).
