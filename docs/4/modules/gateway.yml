  This module adds the ability for IRC gateways to forward the real IP address of users connecting through them.

configuration:
- name: gateway
  description: |-
    The `<gateway>` tag defines a specific IRC gateway. This tag can be defined as many times as required.
  attributes:
  - name: fingerprint

    description: |-
      **Required for the webirc type if password is not set!** The TLS (SSL) client certificate fingerprint that the WebIRC gateway will authenticate with.
  - name: mask
    type: Text
    required: true
    default: null
    description: |-
      The IP address or hostname of the gateway.
  - name: newusername

      If the username type is used then the value to replace usernames that contain hexadecimal-encoded IPv4 addresses.
  - name: type
    type: Text
    required: true
    default: null
    description: |-
      The type of authentication that the gateway uses.
  - name: password

      **Required for the webirc type if fingerprint is not set!** The password that the WebIRC gateway will authenticate with.

      If the webirc type is used the algorithm that the password is hashed with.

    !!! warning ""
        The `hash` field is currently optional but will be required in the next major version of InspIRCd when using password authentication.

    {! 4/modules/_hash_table.md !}

    The type field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value   | Description
    ------- | -----------
    gateway | The IP address of the user will be sent in the username field in hexadecimal (IPv4 only).
    webirc  | The IP address of the user will be sent using the `/WEBIRC` command (recommended).

  example: |-
    Tells the gateway module that the \*.username.gateway.example.com gateway will encode the IPv4 address of users into their username.

    ```xml
    <gateway type="username"
             mask="*.username.gateway.example.com"
             newusername="wobble">
    ```

    Tells the gateway module that gateways with an IP matching 192.0.2.0/24 will send the IP address of users with the `/WEBIRC` command using TLS (SSL) client certificate fingerprint authentication:

    ```xml
    <gateway type="webirc"
             fingerprint="bd90547b59c1942b85f382bc059318f4c6ca54c5"
             mask="192.0.2.0/24">
    ```

    Tells the gateway module that gateways with a hostname matching \*.webirc.gateway.example.com will send the IP address of users with the `/WEBIRC` command using password authentication:

    ```xml
    <gateway type="webirc"
             password="$2a$10$WEUpX9GweJiEF1WxBDSkeODBstIBMlVPweQTG9cKM8/Vd58BeM5cW"
             hash="bcrypt"
             mask="*.webirc.gateway.example.com">
    ```

    This module extends [the core `<connect>` tags](/4/configuration#connect) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name: webirc
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: null
    description: |-
      If defined then a glob pattern to match the name of a WebIRC gateway against.
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Requires that users must be connecting via the "wibble" WebIRC gateway to use the Example class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="Example"
             ...
             webirc="wibble">
    ```

commands:
- name: HEXIP

  syntax: <hex-ip|real-ip>
  description: |-
    Encodes or decodes an IP between its human readable form and its hex form.
  example:
  - description: |-
      Decodes 7f000001 to its human readable form
    text: |-
       /HEXIP 7f000001
  - description: |-
      Encodes 127.0.0.1 to its hex form
    text: |-
      /HEXIP 127.0.0.1
