name: cloak_sha256

introduction: |-
  !!! note ""
      This module can be built against a third-party library ([libpsl](https://github.com/rockdaboot/libpsl)) to add more features.

description: |-
  This module adds the `hmac-sha256` and `hmac-sha256-ip` cloaking methods for use with [the cloak module](/4/modules/cloak).

configuration:
- name: cloak
  description: |-
    The `<cloak>` tag defines a cloaking profile. This tag can be defined as many times as required.
  values_description: |-
    This module also extends the [`<cloak:method>`](/4/modules/cloak#cloak) field with the following values:
  extends: true
  added_values:
  - name: hmac-sha256
    description: |-
      If the user has a DNS hostname or is connecting via a UNIX socket then cloak with an HMAC-SHA256 hash of their hostname and socket path suffixed with the public part of that value. Otherwise, cloak with three HMAC-SHA256 hashes of significant ranges of their IP address (IPv4: /16 /24 /32, IPv6: /32 /48 /64).
  - name: hmac-sha256-ip

    description: |-
      A random 30+ character value to use as a secret key when cloaking. The longer this is the more secure it is.
  - name: prefix

      The value to prefix cloaks with.
  - name: suffix

    description: |-
      Whether to use upper-case or lower-case characters when converting cloak hashes to a human-readable form.
  - name: hostparts
    type: Number
    required: false
    default: 3
    description: |-
      If the hmac-sha256 method is used then the maximum number of DNS hostname segments that should be visible.
  - name: pathparts
    type: Number
    required: false
    default: 1
    description: |-
      The maximum number of UNIX socket path segments that should be visible.

    required: false
    default: 1
    description: |-
      If defined and the module was built against libpsl then the path to a Public Suffix List database to use instead of `<cloak:hostparts>` for finding the public part of a hostname. Can also be set to `system` to use the system database.
  details: |-
    The case field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value | Description
    ----- | -----------
    lower | Use lower-case characters in the cloak hash.
    upper | Use upper-case characters in the cloak hash.

  example: |-
    Cloaking using the hmac-sha256 method:

    ```xml
    <cloak method="hmac-sha256"
           key="changeme"
           prefix="MyNet"
           suffix="ip"
           case="lower"
           hostparts="3"
           pathparts="1"
           psl="system">
    ```

    Cloaking using the hmac-sha256-ip method:

    ```xml
    <cloak method="hmac-sha256-ip"
           key="changeme"
           prefix="MyNet"
           suffix="ip"
           case="lower"
           pathparts="1">
    ```
