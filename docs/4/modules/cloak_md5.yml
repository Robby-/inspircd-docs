introduction: |-
  !!! warning ""
      This module is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of InspIRCd.

      You should migrate to the `hmac-sha256` or `hmac-sha256-addr` cloak methods from [the cloak_sha256 module](/4/modules/cloak_sha256).

      You can keep your `half` and `full` cloak methods as secondary cloak methods in v4 to avoid breaking bans.
