## Installing InspIRCd 4

There are many different methods for installing InspIRCd. You should pick the method which fits your needs best.

### Docker

An official InspIRCd Docker image will be available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inspircd/inspircd-docker/) when v4 is released. Until that happens you will have to build from source.

### Packages

The InspIRCd team will provide prebuilt packages for some common platforms when v4 is released. Until that happens you will have to build from source.

### Source

On all other platforms the recommended installation method is to [build from source](/4/installation/source). You can choose between building the [the most recent release](/4/installation/source#release-tarball) or, if you enjoy living on the edge, [the latest code committed to Git](/4/installation/source#git). If you are building on Windows you should follow [these instructions instead](/4/installation/windows-source).
