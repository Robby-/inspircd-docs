  <nick>[,<nick>]+ [<duration> <reason>]

  If `<duration>` and `<reason>` are specified then prevents a nickname from being used. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero then the Q-line will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<nick>` is specified, removes a reservation on a nickname.
example:

    Q-lines Adam for one day with the reason "Testing"

    /QLINE Adam 1d :Testing

    Q-lines Sadie for one day with the reason "Testing"
